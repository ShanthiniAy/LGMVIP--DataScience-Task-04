## Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism Dataset
This repository contains Python code for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a terrorism dataset. The aim of this analysis is to gain insights into patterns, trends, and hot zones of terrorism incidents based on various attributes present in the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is named "terrorism_data.csv." It contains information about various terrorist incidents, including details such as the year of the incident, the type of attack, the country, the region, the weapon type used, and more.

## Code and Visualization
The Python code for the EDA is provided in the file named "terrorism_analysis.py." This script uses the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization. The analysis is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data:

Loading the Dataset: The code loads the dataset from the "terrorism_data.csv" file using the Pandas library.

Basic Information: The script displays basic information about the dataset, such as the number of rows, columns, and data types.

Previewing the Data: A preview of the first few rows of the dataset is displayed to give an overview of the available information.

Handling Missing Values: The code checks for missing values in the dataset and displays the count of missing values for each attribute.

Trends Over Time: A bar plot is created to visualize the frequency of terrorist incidents over the years.

Types of Attacks: A bar plot is generated to show the most common types of terrorist attacks.

Hot Zones - Countries: The code creates a bar plot to identify the countries with the highest number of terrorist incidents.

Distribution by Region: A bar plot is generated to illustrate the distribution of terrorist incidents by region.

Weapons Used: The script produces a bar plot that shows the weapons commonly used in terrorist incidents.

## Usage
To run the analysis, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Place the "terrorism_data.csv" file in the same directory as the "terrorism_analysis.py" script.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script using the command: python terrorism_analysis.py

The script will generate visualizations and display them in separate windows.

## Conclusion
The EDA conducted using this script provides valuable insights into the patterns and trends of terrorism incidents based on the attributes present in the dataset. The visualizations highlight hot zones, types of attacks, regions affected, and weapons commonly used in terrorism incidents.

Please note that this analysis serves as a starting point and can be further extended to perform more in-depth analysis and modeling.
